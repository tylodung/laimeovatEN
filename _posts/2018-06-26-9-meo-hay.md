The way to keep the herbs fresh
First, wash them and put them in the blisters, then put them into the freezer; By doing so you retain the vitamin content in them. When the herbs have wilted and turn yellow, you can also mix some olive oil and then freeze to preserve them.

How to preserve shell nuts
Place the nuts in the fridge to keep the nutrients, taste and aroma intact. Make sure they are sealed in a sealed container before putting it in the freezer. Grains must be unprocessed raw grain. Grains that are kept in this way will not have the same bitter taste as shell nuts preserved at room temperature for a period of time.
