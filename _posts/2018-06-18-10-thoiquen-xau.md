The following are the teachings of the Dalai Lama who can help you overcome this situation.

Keep promise
Do not promise anything to others if you do not. If you try to be kind to someone this way, you will soon destroy your self image and energy. So, if you have promised, keep the word.

Keep away from the "toxic"
Do you have the habit of helping others but eventually getting complaints and negative outlooks from others? The solution is to try to get your surroundings filled with positive energies, such as good people, savvy people, and limited contact with bad people.

Debt repayment
"Do not owe anybody anything" - this sentence should become your living maxim. Make the habit of repaying at the right time, treat others the way you want them to treat you.

Learn to forgive
If you choose to live with hatred, you are choosing to suffer. Instead of poisoning yourself with hatred, know how to forgive and continue living, whether or not there is someone worthy of your forgiveness, learn to forgive to bring about energy Leave your body alone, then you'll feel like you're dumping the weight off your chest, trust me.

Focus on what you like
Sometimes we need to do things we do not enjoy, but when possible, put aside things that do not belong to you and focus on what you are really passionate about.

Every moment has its own purpose
Our life takes time to rest and time to work. Both are equally important and necessary. Do not forget this.

Do not clutter ... let's refresh things!
If you want your life to run smoothly, never get stuck. Start rearranging your bedroom, or refresh your wardrobe. Living space reflects the energy of you, and clutter is the agent that prevents that natural flow. So, if you want to purify your mind, start clearing up all the chaos in your mind and space.

Facing adversity
Do not avoid when confronted with anything. If anything bother you, show it off and completely remove it from your life. Do not wait for the solution from the sky to fall, they are very close to you, your task is just look around.

Pay attention to your health
Even the most perfect mind can not do without health. People who tend to take good care of both the mind and body tend to have a happier life. So, try to put less effort into taking care of your own health.

Let life float
You are part of everything, and everything is a part of you. Stop facing life and accept it. Let yourself be drifting in the natural flow. Remember that you are the driver of the boat.
