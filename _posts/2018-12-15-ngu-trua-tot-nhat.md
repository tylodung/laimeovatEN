Healthy or weak liver due to sleep. Because sleep is regenerated and restored. In addition to going to bed early, nap is extremely important.

Noise is to keep the liver, how to sleep is the new way?

Doctors do not sleep at noon, spoil the afternoon. It is said that such a short nap gives the body many benefits. If you have difficulty sleeping, even if only a few minutes, you will find very different. However, if you sleep too long, when you wake up will feel numb limbs, headache, dizziness, laziness, lack of energy.

So what should be the last nap? This is the general advice of the experts.

Time: Should sleep about half an hour most appropriate

Sleeping time, not the time you need to sleep for "had eyes" that should only sleep up to about 30 minutes. If not enough time, should not sleep?

Sleeping from 10 to 20 seconds

Many people for work, usually do not have enough time to rest for lunch, but remember, just eye-aiming for about 10-20 seconds can also bring benefits not small for health .

When you are tired, you can immediately close your eyes, relax your mind completely, focus on resting, in just a few tens of seconds can also change the tired state quickly, restore psychological and spiritual.

Sleep short for 2-5 minutes

Do not underestimate a few minutes of this wonderful "lunch break", though for a few minutes you should try to see the great effect of eliminating fatigue.

Many people working for a long time, especially office workers make you headache, memory decline gradually, often remember forget forget, lack of concentration. At this point, "turn a blind eye" to rest for a few minutes, until the body relax, calm, will create new inspiration, improve work efficiency.

Lunch for 20 to 30 minutes

If you need to enhance your memory in the long run, the best sleep alternative is around this time. A full 30 minutes is the best time to support and care for the liver. This time is enough for the liver to regain harmony and restore balance.

Because after lunch, blood in the body focuses on the digestive tract to digest food. If food is eaten or moved, blood flow to the hands and feet leads to insufficient blood supply to the liver, leading to metabolic processes in the liver that are affected.

Therefore, take the time to have a good nap during 20-30 minutes, thus maintaining good liver function, enhancing digestion, maintaining balance and staying healthy.

Sleep for 40-90 minutes

This is a long nap, although you feel "more" than it is an unhealthy habit. Because the nap time is over 30 minutes, the body will go to deep sleep, about 45 minutes later if you wake up will feel headaches and other moody tiredness.

If you have enough time, choose a 30 minute nap, or take a 1-1.5 hour deep sleep instead of choosing a time between these two. 1.5 hours can be considered a complete sleep.

Posture: It is best to use a U-pillow for a good nap

You can choose a U pillow, lying on the couch or lying on the floor, closing your eyes and keeping the spine straight.

If you have no other choice, you can hold a pillow and sit in a chair to ease the pressure on your forearm. After lunch, do some stretching exercises to reduce pressure and help blood circulation.
