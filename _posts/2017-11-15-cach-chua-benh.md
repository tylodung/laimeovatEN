Do not rub your eyes to the cornea. Just sticking out his tongue licking a few edges, tears will ejaculate "strange play" out of the eye! Remember: if you have the right eye, lick the left side and vice versa.

Eyes closed:
An unblocked eye (due to paroxysmal necrosis of the 7th, for example), orthodox symmetry. On several occasions, every few minutes, the eyes will gradually close.
